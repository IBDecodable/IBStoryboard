# IBStoryboard

This package contains code to make work with Storyboards and segues easier bu using objects/protocols instead of string.
It work in symbiosis with the code generated by [ibgenerate](https://github.com/ibdecodable/ibgenerate).

It heavily inspired from code generated by [natalie](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie) by Marcin Krzy≈ºanowski 
and me (Eric Marchand) for `macOS`, using object for decoding XML, etc...

So this package contains only the static code that never change between projects.
You need [ibgenerate](https://github.com/ibdecodable/ibgenerate) for the dynamic code.
